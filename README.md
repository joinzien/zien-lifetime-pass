# Open Edition Expanded NFTs

Based on the [Zora NFT Editions](https://github.com/ourzora/nft-editions) contracts.

## What are these contracts?

1. `OpenEditionsNFT`
   Each drop is a unique contract.
   This allows for easy royalty collection, clear ownership of the collection, and your contract 🎉
2. `DropCreator`
   Gas-optimized factory contract allowing you to easily + for a low gas transaction create your drop mintable contract.
